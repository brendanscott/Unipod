Annoyed with the hopeless media player on the htc desire, I'm putting together a player for use with university podcasts and ebooks.  It will (hopefully?) have better treatment of playlists and better in-media navigation.  Best of all (when I work out how to do it) it will kill the frickin' hands free play button, which starts playback whenever it is bumped.
